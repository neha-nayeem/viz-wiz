## Topic and Questions
This is a short data visualization project about forests. We explore the answers to the following questions using Tableau Public:

1. How much of Canada used to be covered by forests, and what portion is covered today?
2. How much deforestation occurs each year in the country? 
3. Which provinces (or zones) have the witnessed the most deforestation and which show increasing forest growth? 
4. How many trees were planted yearly (or hectares of land) vs how many trees were lost to fire yearly (or hectares of land)?
